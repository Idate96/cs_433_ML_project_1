# Cs 433 Machine Learning Project I : Higgs Challenge
This is the result of the project I for the course cs 433 Machine Learning at EPFL.
The model developed is able to classify the events (signal or noise)
relevant for the detection of the Higgs Boson. More info in https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/leaderboard
## Getting Started
Git clone the repository.
To run the model:
```
python run.py
```
It will reproduce the best results obtained with it.
They are saved in the folder results.

### Prerequisites
```
